## Housing Price Prediction Project

## Overview

This project aims to delve into the fascinating world of real estate by predicting housing prices based on key features such as square footage, the number of bedrooms, and bathrooms. By employing a linear regression model, we analyze how these factors influence market values, providing valuable insights for homebuyers and real estate professionals alike.

## Features

- **Price Prediction**: Accurately predicts housing prices using:
  - Square footage
  - Number of bedrooms
  - Number of bathrooms
- **Linear Regression Model**: Utilizes a well-established linear regression framework for effective analysis and predictions.
- **Data Visualization**: Includes visualizations to illustrate relationships between features and predicted prices, enhancing understanding of the data.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
   cd your_repository
   ```

2. **Install Required Packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset and place it in the specified folder.
2. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   python housing_price_prediction.py
   ```

3. Follow the instructions in the notebook/script to input your data and generate predictions.

## Dataset

The dataset, located in the `data` folder, includes various housing features essential for price prediction. Be sure to preprocess the data as needed before running the model.

## Model

This project employs linear regression due to its effectiveness and interpretability. Key steps in our methodology include:

- Data preprocessing
- Feature selection
- Model training and evaluation

## Results

The model’s performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared values. Visualizations, such as scatter plots of predicted vs. actual prices, help convey the model’s effectiveness.
